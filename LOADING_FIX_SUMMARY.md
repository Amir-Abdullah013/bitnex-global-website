# 🎯 Infinite Loading Fix - Quick Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved

Your website was stuck in an infinite loading loop on dashboard and trade pages. **This is now FIXED!**

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. **Main Issue: UniversalProvider Context**
- **Problem:** `dataLoaded` was in the useEffect dependency array, causing infinite re-renders
- **Solution:** Removed `dataLoaded` from the dependency array
- **File:** `src/lib/universal-context.js`

### 2. **Secondary Issue: Trade Page Loading**
- **Problem:** Redundant timeout conflicting with data fetch loading state
- **Solution:** Removed redundant timeout, rely on fetch completion
- **File:** `src/app/user/trade/page.js`

## 🚀 How to Test

1. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test these pages:**
   - Go to `/user/dashboard` - Should load in 1-2 seconds
   - Go to `/user/trade` - Should load market data quickly
   - Go to `/plans` - Should show investment plans

3. **What you should see:**
   - ✅ Loading spinner for 1-2 seconds max
   - ✅ Content appears after loading
   - ✅ No infinite spinning
   - ✅ Pages work smoothly
